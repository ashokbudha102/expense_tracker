# expense_tracker
This expense tracker is based upon Django(a python web framework). This app is based upon adding of expenses data, 
sorting them, downloading in the form of .csv, .xlsx, etc. 
It will also provide the feature of dynamic and interactive charts and graphs. 
Hope we will be coming up with other better features in coming days. . .
